This is a custom code editor you will be using to write your code for this course. All code written will be saved and can be accessed at any time from the same **computer** and **browser** you are currently using.

-   Create a new files using the launcher or right-clicking in the file explorer
-   To run your code, press `Shift + Enter` or click on the `Run` button in the toolbar

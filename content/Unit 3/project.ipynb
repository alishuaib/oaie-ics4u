    "# Project: Inventory Management System\n",
    "This project will be divided in two parts. Modular Design and Algorithm Analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 1: Modular Design\n",
    "Follow along with the guided tutorials in Unit 3.1 to create a simple inventory management system in python using the specifications below. This is a graded project so be sure to complete and submit all deliverables.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 2: Algorithm Analysis\n",
    "Afterwards follow the guided tutorial in Unit 3.2 Activity to implement search and sort algorithms in python, you will also analyze the performance of these algorithms. This is also a graded so be sure to submit it separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be graded on the following:\n",
    "- Project completion for Part 1\n",
    "- Project completion for Part 2\n",
    "- Two page report on modular design principles used and algorithm analysis conclusions.\n",

    "In this activity, you will solve a series of problems that involve using different data types and expressions in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each problem will have a description, code cell and expected output.\n",
    "- Description: This will explain the task you need to perform.\n",
    "- Code cell: This is where you should write your solution.\n",
    "- Expected output: This will show the expected output that your code should produce if it is correct.\n",

    "## Interactive Dice Game\n",
    "\n",
    "Using modular design principles, you will create a simple dice game. \n",
    "\n",
    "The game will be played between two players. Each player will roll a dice, and the player with the highest number wins the round.\n",
    "\n",
    "After each round, the players will have the option to play again or exit the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the following tasks:\n",
    "- Create the classes `Player` and `Dice`.\n",
    "  - The `Dice` class will have attributes `sides` amd the method `roll` that generates a random number between 1 and `sides`.\n",
    "  - The `Player` class will have the attributes `name`, `score` and `dice`.\n",
    "- The gameplay logic will be implemented in 3 functions:\n",
    "  - `create_player()` that get a players name using `input()` and create a `Player` class object.\n",
    "  - `play_round(p1,p2)` that rolls the dice for each player, displays the results and updates the score.\n",
    "  - `display_scores(p1,p2)` that shows the current score of each player. It should also display current winner.\n",
    "- The `main_game()` function will do the following:\n",
    "  - Create two players using `create_player()`.\n",
    "  - Create a `while True` loop that will run the game until the players decide to exit.\n",
    "  - Each iteration of the loop will call `play_round(p1,p2)` and `display_scores(p1,p2)`.\n",
    "  - At the end of each loop, ask to play another round, if not, display the final scores and exit the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to use the `random` library for this activity.\n",
